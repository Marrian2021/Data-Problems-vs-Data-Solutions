## What is the business problem

The cancellations of airport trips by drivers increases. A trip to the airport takes longer for drivers due to traffic. Most passengers would cancel a trip request before the driver arrives. This has caUsed a decrease in supply of lifts at the airports.


## How was it translated into a data mining problem?


Based on the traffic patterns and flight schedules, the is more cars coming from the airport in the mornings and less cars in the night. This leads to an in balance, too much inflow of cars in the morning and less in the evenings causing a rise in cancellations 

Driver idle time.  when a trip is cancelled,how long a dirver will wait to get a new trip back. This results in loss of sales.  

The Inflow/outflow of cars at the airport depending on the time of the day, figuring out how to make this a market equilibrium 

## What is the realized business value?

Uber leverages predictive modeling in real-time based on traffic patterns, supply and demand. Double pricing of trips to the airport or high traffic area is a businrss advantage.
